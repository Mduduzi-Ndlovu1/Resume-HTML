  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
  <p>
    As a full stack web developer, I spend my free time pursuing various hobbies that help me relax and unwind. Here are a few of my favorite hobbies:
  </p>

  <h2>Playing MOBAs - League of Legends</h2>
  <p>
    League of Legends is one of my go-to games when I want to dive into the world of multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs). I enjoy the strategic gameplay, team coordination, and the thrill of intense battles. It's a fantastic way to challenge my skills, work with teammates, and experience the ever-evolving competitive scene.

  <h2>Exploring RPGs - Path of Exile</h2>
  <p>
    RPGs have always fascinated me with their immersive worlds and character development. Path of Exile, in particular, captures my attention with its vast skill tree, complex itemization, and challenging gameplay. I love embarking on epic quests, battling formidable foes, and customizing my character's abilities to create unique playstyles.

  <h2>Engaging in FPS - Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
  <p>
    Rainbow Six Siege is my go-to game when I crave tactical first-person shooter (FPS) action. I enjoy the strategic gameplay, team coordination, and the adrenaline rush that comes with intense firefights and close-quarters combat. It requires quick thinking, precise aiming, and effective communication, making every match an exhilarating experience.

    These hobbies not only provide me with entertainment but also offer opportunities to collaborate, improve my problem-solving skills, and connect with a vibrant gaming community.
